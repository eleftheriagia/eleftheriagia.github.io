  <p>Portfolio</p>
<p> For my Independent Project, I am proposing to create a portfolio website titled “Eleftheria In Design”.  This project will be a complete showcase of all my work and artistic capabilities.  In the past, when I have applied for internships or jobs, I have used a website that is entirely focused to my photography regardless if the position was even photography related. Since I am a Senior graduating in a few months, I will be applying to jobs a bit more seriously with more intent on sealing a position and I need to make sure I have a portfolio that proudly proclaims all of the creative design work I have done within the past few years.  I want to be able to have a website that displays my user research, design, coding, digital marketing, and photography abilities.  My projected audience would be dedicated towards a more networking focus as well as potential design employers and clients who are looking for freelance artist or a photographer.  As for my timeline and deliverables, my chosen two deliverables will be UX Design and Prototyping (with Adobe XD), and UX Research which goals are directed with user personas. I will be working towards completing different sections every week. </p>
